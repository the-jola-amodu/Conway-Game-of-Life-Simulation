# ðŸŒ± Conway's Game of Life â€” Raylib Simulation (C++)

This project is a graphical simulation of **Conway's Game of Life**, implemented in **C++** using the **Raylib** graphics library. It features real-time interactivity, customizable grids, and a toroidal (wrap-around) worldâ€”designed with Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## ðŸ§  About the Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game where cells on a grid live, die, or multiply based on a set of simple rules. Despite the simplicity, it produces surprisingly complex behaviors and is a classic example of cellular automata.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- **Real-time Simulation**: Watch generations evolve in real time.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - **Speed Adjustment**: Speed up or slow down the simulation.
  - **Random Generation**: Instantly populate the grid with random live cells.
  - **Mouse Editing**: Manually toggle individual cells on or off to create custom patterns.
- **Toroidal Grid**: The grid wraps around the edges, giving the illusion of an infinite world.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean and modular C++ code structure.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)
- **Build System**: g++ (can be configured with `task.json` or `CMake`)
