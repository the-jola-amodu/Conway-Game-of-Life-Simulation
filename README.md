# Conway-Game-of-Life-Simulation
This is a Simulation of Conway's Game of Life using C++. 
To simulate the continuity in the Game of Life, a toroidal grid is used, allowing it wrap round on itself. The simulation was built using the Raylib library and allows you to generate random grids, create custom ones using the mouse and control the speed of the simulation.
